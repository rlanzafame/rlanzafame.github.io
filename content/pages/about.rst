I am currently looking for work in California (San Francisco Bay Area). Until August, 2025
I was a Senior Lecturer at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.

This website may grow in the future, but for now it provides a link to my `CV`_ and my contact information.

Thanks to Jason Moore for the `template`_, and so many other great ideas 
related to education, open source tools and much more.

This website is built in `this repository`_ and uses material liberally from Jason's repo `here`_.
