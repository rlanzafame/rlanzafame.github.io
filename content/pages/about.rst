I am currently a Senior Lecturer at Delft University of Technology in the 
Netherlands. This website will collect...stuff.

Thanks to Jason Moore for the `template`_, and so many other great ideas 
related to education, open source tools and much more.

This website is built in `this repository`_ and uses material liberally from Jason's repo `here`_.
