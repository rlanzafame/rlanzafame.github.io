# Source files for Robert Lanzafame's Personal Website

Started October, 2024. Content will come later.

Borrowing liberally from Jason Moore's websites like this one: [github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io](https://github.com/mechmotum/mechmotum.github.io).

Setup notes:
- started with Jason's `env.yml` file
- used Pelican's quickstart method
- copied Jason's config file
- forked [Jason's template repo](https://github.com/mechmotum/pelican-alchemy) ([my repo](https://github.com/rlanzafame/pelican-alchemy))
- created an assets repo [github.com/rlanzafame/assets](https://github.com/rlanzafame/assets) to keep images out of this one
- copied Jason's github workflows file. adapted the branch rules to build on main and put the built site (output) on gh-pages
- make sure that the source is built from a branch in the repo settings
